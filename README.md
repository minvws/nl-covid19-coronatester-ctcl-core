# CoronaTester CTCL

This is a proof of concept (PoC) for creating a QR code system for proving that one has had a valid negative test result or a vaccination record (FHIR). 

Key features to demonstrate are

1. Show that it is possible to sign or otherwise make values shown (such as I was tested negative on Thursday) somewhat tamper resistent.
1. Data minimisation - show that it is possible to selectively disclose only certain fields (depending on context) -- whilst keeping things such as digital signatures intact.
1. Unlinkability - make it impossible (or hard) to use the data shared to track a holder (citizen) (e.g. by the verifier simply recording all signatures shown, or by the issuering hearing of validations).
1. Show that this can by largely done off-line; not requiring a connection by the holder.

The cryptographic technologies are based on Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signatures and Zero Knowledge Proofs in general, and those of Idemix / Identiy Mixer (and IRMA.app) in particular.

## Context

This PoC is part of a wider piece of work to map, assess and curtail the privacy and security risks associated with the use cases for a citizen being able to prove vaccination or the veracity of a negative test result. This is driven by the anticipated need for a COVID-19 proof of vaccination requirement internationally. Note that there is currently no national requirement for such proof.

In particular, the risks and mitigations are explored for both paper-based and digital versions of possible implementations for a proof of vaccination or negative test.

This document explores the realm of possible technical implementation options and the social and legal requirements that constrain which of the technical implementations may be chosen. As such, this interplay defines the envelope within which realistic solutions are likely to fit.

## Description

The aim for this project is to be able to show the whole process of how the proposed system might work. There are three main individuals: issuer, holder, and verifier. 
- The issuer is a medical institute that has provided the vaccine or negative test result, and has been certified by a government to hand out such certificates.    
- The holder is an individual who has been vaccinated or negatively tested. 
- The verifier is an individual or organization who would like to verify that the holder has been vaccinated or negatively tested.

There is already a standard medical message for immunization in HL7 (both v3 CDA and FHIR) which can be re-used also for COVID-19 purposes. We use the work that was done in [nl-eHealth-experimental](https://github.com/minvws/nl-eHealth-experimental/tree/master/examples/smartvac) repository to produce a FHIR record that has been encoded as a protobuf. We use a subset of the FHIR record that is in the draft version of the WHO requirements.

The records are signed with a Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signature, which allows the proof to be presented in an unlinkable way by means of a Zero Knowledge Proof.

### Goals

This project is a work in progress. Below if is high level overview of what has been done and what still is being worked on.

Done: 
- Unlinkability: The holder creates a new QR code to present on every scan. QR codes cannot be linked between usages, to the issuance event or to an individual, by the signature itself.

- Fits in a QR, can be done offline for the _holder_

- Can contain FHIR(ish) data 
    - Have the FHIR data from the WHO minimal data sets  

Work In Progress:
- One can mask values 'at will' (selective disclosure)
- Multi-country example code
    - Generate a QR code from citizen in country A and scan by country B.
